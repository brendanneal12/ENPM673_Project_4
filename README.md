# Project Information
Goal: Stereo Vision Application to generate disparity and depth images.

File Names: proj_4_artroom.py, proj_4_chess.py, proj_4_ladder.py

Recommended IDE: Visual Studio Code

Python Version: 3

# Libraries Used:
numpy, opencv, pyplot, math, timeit

# Important Notes
1. There is a separate scripts for each data set.
2. During the execution of the program, there might be an errors thrown for different reasons, especially on the chess data set. There are a few badly matched features and the RASNAC function may occasionally pull them and it breaks the code. Please rerun. This code works 95% of the time, and I have done everything in my power to filter the bad features.

# How to Run Code
1. Download each of the files and place them into their respective folders (proj_4_artroom.py goes into the artroom folder, etc.)
2.
